# Item-Based-Recommendation-Movie-DS
Recommender systems have been around for a while. Youtube, Facebook, Amazon and many others offer some kind of recommendation to their users.Here we explore the relationship between the product pair (the user who bought Y also bought Z). We find the missing rating with the help of the ratings given by the user to other items.

It was first invented and used by Amazon in 1998. Rather than matching the user with similar customers, item-to-item collaborative filtering matches each of the items the user has purchased and rated with similar items, and then combines those similar items into a recommendation list.

Item-based recommendation is a form of collaborative filtering for recommendation systems based on similarity between items, calculated using the ratings people give to those items.
