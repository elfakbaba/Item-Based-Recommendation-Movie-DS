# Item-Based Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This project implements an item-based movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. It leverages a movie ratings dataset to recommend movies to users based on the similarity between items (movies) that they have previously rated.

## Project Description

### Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

Item-based collaborative filtering focuses on finding relationships between items rather than users. It identifies movies that have similar rating patterns from users and recommends those similar movies to users who enjoyed a particular movie. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **User-Item Rating Matrix:** Construct a matrix where rows represent users and columns represent movies. The cell values represent the rating given by each user to each movie.
2. **Item Similarity Calculation:** Employ similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity) to determine how similar each pair of movies is based on the ratings they received from users.
3. **Recommendation Generation:** For a user who rated specific movies, identify highly similar movies based on the calculated similarities. Recommend these similar movies to the user.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of movie ratings from users. Here's a breakdown of the columns:

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| movieId | Integer | Unique identifier for each movie |
| title | String | Title of the movie |
| genres | String | Genres associated with the movie (e.g., "Comedy, Drama") |
| userId | Integer | Unique identifier for each user |
| rating | Float | Rating given by the user to the movie on a specific scale |
| timestamp | Datetime | Date and time of the rating |
